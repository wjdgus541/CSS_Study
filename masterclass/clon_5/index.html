          <span>About</span>Schwartz Media publishes intelligent news
          and current affairs that breaks the 24-hour news cycle.
          We offer a nuanced examination of Australia and the world, 
          focused on fresh insight and literary expression. Our audience 
          reads to know, not just to agree. We invest in long-form journalism 
          where the issues demand it, providing writing of a quality that makes
          difficult topics clear. Schwartz Media publishes Australiaâ€™s most 
          respected writers across The Saturday Paper, The Monthly magazine and
          the daily podcast 7am, alongside our sister publications, Quarterly
          Essay and Australian Foreign Affairs.
